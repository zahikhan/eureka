# Microservice Registry and Communication with Eureka and RestTemplate

This repository contains a simple implementation of a microservice architecture using Netflix Eureka for service registry and discovery, and RestTemplate for inter-service communication. The project demonstrates how to set up a service registry and enable services to communicate with each other through the registry.

## Introduction

In a microservices architecture, services need a way to find and communicate with each other. Eureka is a service registry that allows services to register themselves and discover other services. RestTemplate is a common tool for making HTTP requests between services.

This project provides a basic setup for a service registry using Eureka and demonstrates how two microservices can communicate with each other through the registry using RestTemplate.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Open the project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Build and run the Eureka server and microservices. You may need to configure the port numbers and other properties in the application configuration files.

Access the Eureka dashboard to see the registered services by visiting http://localhost:8761 in your web browser.

Use the RestTemplate client to make requests to other services through the Eureka server for service discovery.
